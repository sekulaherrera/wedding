    "intro_p_id": "On a Friday night, I was sitting in a train returning from a business trip from Hamburg to Berlin. It was a difficult week with a client and all I wanted is to get back home, take a shower, and rest. However, a friend of mine, Monse, called me, asking me for help. Honestly, I was considering to deny the request and just continue on with my plan to rest. Something in my mind told me to be a nice guy and help her, instead. So that's what I did: I told her to let me get back home, take a shower, and I will be with her in a couple of hours. When I arrived at her place, all I could see was Daniela - not even remotely noticing all of the Mexicans standing in Monse's kitchen. This was the day I knew that I was going to marry her. A couple years down the line, here we are, inviting you to our wedding. I knew I was right...😉",
